# CUGC-DB

## The greatest membership database ever. Made specifically for the Cornell University Glee Club.

#### Purpose

This database was made to manage, in-house, the Glee Club membership database. We had a Microsoft Excel file that contained most of the data, but we often had to lean on Cornell University Alumni Affairs to provide for us contact information, such as mailing addresses. By managing our membership history ourselves, we have better access to this information and believe our alumni may be more willing to send us their updated information, rather than sending it to the university.

Additionally, it is often important to have some background information on a particular alumnus upon contacting or meeting him. This information will be readily accessible on the database.

#### Technologies

- CakePHP
- (mt) servers
- MySQL

### Credits

The entire database was created by [Parker Moore '14](http://www.parkermoore.de/), with the advisement of Patrick Chamberlain '13 and Eric Burkholder '14.
